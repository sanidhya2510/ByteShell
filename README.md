# ByteShell

## Introduction
Welcome to the Byteshell project! This project is a command-line utility written in C that provides a simple shell environment with various functions implemented, including `cd`, `help`, `exit`, `history`, `pwd`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `head`. This project aims to demonstrate basic shell functionalities and serve as a starting point for building more advanced shell applications.

## Features
The Byteshell project provides the following features:

- **cd**: Change the current working directory to the specified directory.
- **help**: Display information about the available commands.
- **exit**: Terminate the shell application and return to the operating system.
- **history**: View a list of previously executed commands.
- **pwd**: Display the current working directory.
- **echo**: Display a message or the value of a variable.
- **mkdir**: Create a new Directory in the Present working Directory
- **touch**: Create a new file in the Present working Directory
- **head**: Print first 10 lines of the given Input file

## Requirements
To compile and run the Byteshell project, you need the following:

1. C compiler (e.g., GCC)
2. C standard library
3. WSL (if used on windows)

## Usage
Follow the steps below to compile and run the Byteshell project:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the source code using the C compiler.
5. Run the compiled executable.
6. You should now see the Byteshell prompt (`<<Custom Byteshell June 2023>>`) indicating that the shell is running.
7. Now you can write your own commands and use this shell.
